# Core dependencies
Django>=4.2,<5.0
djangorestframework>=3.14,<4.0
python-decouple>=3.7
psycopg2-binary>=2.9

# Optional / Useful
# If you deploy with Gunicorn
gunicorn>=20.1

# Development / linters (optional)

# Notes:
# - If you use GeoDjango/PostGIS, install the system libraries (gdal, libgdal-dev)
#   before installing Python packages. On many systems you don't need extra pip
#   packages for PostGIS support beyond psycopg2-binary.
# - Frontend libraries (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Leaflet, Chart.js) are included via CDN
#   in templates, so they are not listed here.
